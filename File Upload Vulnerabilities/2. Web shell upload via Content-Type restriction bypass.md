In the proxy history, notice that your image was fetched using a GET request to /files/avatars/ And one post request to /my-account/avatar also will be there . Send this two request to Burp Repeater.

In Burp, go to Proxy > HTTP history. Click the filter bar to open the Filter settings dialog. Under Filter by MIME type, enable the Images checkbox, then apply your changes.

In the proxy history, notice that your image was fetched using a GET request to /files/avatars/ And one post request to /my-account/avatar also will be there . Send this two request to Burp Repeater.

` /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>`

Send this two request to Burp Repeater.

In POST request `/my-account/avatar` we will remove the image content and change the file name and add a php script `<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?> `

orginal `/my-account/avatar` post request.

After inserting the payload script and changing the file name to `exploit.php`.

Now go to GET request  `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>` and change the file name to `exploit.php` and send.

Before changing the name the qurey was like this.

After change the file name to `exploit.php` to see the secret content of the of folder in `/home/carlos/secret` with help of that php script `<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>` .

The secret content is `asyUKxmWd7V9VxBdwszffYgsr1SDmldu`

Now go to Home page and submit the solution.
