In the proxy history, notice that your image was fetched using a GET request to `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>` And one post request to `/my-account/avatar` also will be there . Send this two request to Burp Repeater.

In POST request - `/my-account/avatar` we will remove the image content and change the file name to exploit.php and add a php script `<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>`

error came saying "Sorry, only JPG & PNG files are allowed".

Change the value of the filename parameter to include a URL encoded null byte, followed by the .png extension:
