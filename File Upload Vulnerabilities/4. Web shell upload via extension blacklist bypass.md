## Solution:

Log in and upload an image as your avatar, then go back to your account page.

In the proxy history, notice that your image was fetched using a GET request to `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>` And one post request to `/my-account/avatar` also will be there . Send this two request to Burp Repeater.

In POST request - `/my-account/avatar` we will remove the image content and change the file name to exploit.php and add a php script `<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>`

But now in post request it is saying it php files are not allowed.

So we will be changing the value of the filename parameter to `.htaccess`.

Change the value of the Content-Type header to `text/plain`. ANd Replace the contents of the file (your PHP payload) with the following Apache directive:

`AddType application/x-httpd-php .shell`

`This maps an arbitrary extension (.shell) to the executable MIME type application/x-httpd-php. As the server uses the mod_php module, it knows how to handle this already.

Use the back arrow in Burp Repeater to return to the original request for uploading your PHP exploit.And Change the value of the filename parameter from exploit.php to exploit.shell then

Send the request again and notice that the file was uploaded successfully.

In GET request-

Change the file name to exploit.shell and send.

The secret content is `iXSfj7AZYOKFqBPIbmdtGkUheTeYB12p` 

Now go to Home page and submit the solution.
