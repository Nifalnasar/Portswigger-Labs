In the proxy history, notice that your image was fetched using a GET request to `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>` And one post request to `/my-account/avatar` also will be there . Send this two request to Burp Repeater.

In POST request /my-account/avatar we will remove the image content and change the file name to exploit.php and add a php script `<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>`

Now go to GET request `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>` and change the file name to `exploit.php` and send.

By using file name as `../myexploit.php` it can be noted that the server is stripping the directory traversal sequence but not able retrive the data.

Obfuscate the directory traversal sequence by URL encoding the forward slash (/) character, resulting in:

`filename="..%2fexploit.php"`
