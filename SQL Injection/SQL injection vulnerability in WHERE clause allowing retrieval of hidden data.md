This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products.
