## Solution:

the ```POST /my-account/change-email``` request and notice that this doesn't contain any unpredictable tokens, so may be vulnerable to CSRF if you can bypass any SameSite cookie restrictions.

Look at the response to your ```POST /login``` request. Notice that the website explicitly specifies ```SameSite=Strict``` when setting session cookies. This prevents the browser from including these cookies in cross-site requests.

## Identify a suitable gadget

In the browser, go to one of the blog posts and post an arbitrary comment. Observe that you're initially sent to a confirmation page at ```/post/comment/confirmation?postId=x``` but, after a few seconds, you're taken back to the blog post.

Study the JavaScript and notice that this uses the postId query parameter to dynamically construct the path for the client-side redirect.

In the proxy history, right-click on the GET ```/post/comment/confirmation?postId=9``` request and select Copy URL.And Try injecting a ```path traversal``` sequence so that the dynamically constructed redirect URL will point to your account page:

```/post/comment/confirmation?postId=9/../../my-account```

Observe that the browser normalizes this URL and successfully takes you to your account page. This confirms that you can use the postId parameter to elicit a GET request for an arbitrary endpoint on the target site.

## Bypass the SameSite restrictions

In the browser, go to the exploit server and create a script that induces the viewer's browser to send the GET request you just tested. The following is one possible approach:
