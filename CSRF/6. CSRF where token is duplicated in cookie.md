## Solution:

Login with the credentials and change the email ID and send this to the repeater

Perform a search, send the resulting request to Burp Repeater, and observe that the search term gets reflected in the Set-Cookie header. Since the search function has no CSRF protection, you can use this to inject cookies into the victim user's browser.

Sure enough, the request goes through and the email is updated.

Perform a search, send the resulting request to Burp Repeater, and observe that the search term gets reflected in the Set-Cookie header. Since the search function has no CSRF protection, you can use this to inject cookies into the victim user's browser.

Create a URL that uses this vulnerability to inject a fake csrf cookie into the victim's browser:

```/?search=hii%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrf=test```

To create the exploit, I use the CSRF PoC generator of Burp Suite.And remove the auto-submit <script> block and instead add the following code to inject the cookie and submit the form:

``` <img src="https://0a5a007c04f7f14a84367c1200fc00f2.web-security-academy.net/?search=test%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrf=anytoken%3b%20SameSite=None" onerror="document.forms[0].submit();"/>```

Goto exploit server and change the body
