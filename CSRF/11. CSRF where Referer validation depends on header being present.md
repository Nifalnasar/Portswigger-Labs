## Solution:

Open Burp's browser and log in to your account. Submit the "Update email" form, and find the resulting request in your Proxy history.

Then Delete the Referer header entirely and observe that the request is now accepted.

request worked.

Create and host a proof of concept exploit as described in the solution to the CSRF vulnerability with no defenses lab. Include the following HTML to suppress the Referer header:

```
<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">
```

now Generte the payload an insert this payload in that.
