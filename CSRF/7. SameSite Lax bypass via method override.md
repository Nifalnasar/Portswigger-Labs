Send the POST /my-account/change-email request to Burp Repeater.And Study the ```POST``` /my-account/change-email request and notice that this doesn't contain any unpredictable tokens so may be vulnerable to CSRF if you can bypass the ```SameSite``` cookie restrictions.

Look at the response to your ```POST /login``` request. Notice that the website doesn't explicitly specify any SameSite restrictions when setting session cookies. As a result, the browser will use the default ```Lax``` restriction level.

Recognize that this means the session cookie will be sent in cross-site ```GET``` requests, as long as they involve top-level navigation.

In Burp Repeater, right-click on the request and select Change request method. Burp automatically generates an equivalent GET request.And send the request. Observe that the endpoint only allows POST requests.

Try overriding the method by adding the ```_method``` parameter to the query string:

```/my-account/change-email?email=foo%40web-security-academy.net&_method=POST```
Send the request. Observe that this has been accepted by the server.
