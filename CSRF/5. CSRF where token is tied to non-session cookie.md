## Solution:

As usual, the lab application is the blog website. I am again provided with two sets of valid credentials. I login with the known credentials for ```wiener``` and change the email address. This results in the following request:

There are some things expected and other things rather interesting. The session cookie and the csrf-tokens are the expected parts. But there is a second cookie ```csrfKey```, that looks very similar to a second session value.

All values remain static for the session. When I logout and login again as the same user, the session cookie changes (this is expected) but csrfKey and csrf-token remain the same.

This indicates that the system providing the CSRF protection does not integrate into the session system, but creates its own type of session that is not in sync. This might violate the tightly connected property mentioned earlier.

So I check with the second user account. To ensure the sessions do not get mixed up I use the Burp Browser for this. So I login as carlos, switch intercept on and change the email address.

The intercepted request I then modify in Burp to contain the session ID from the current carlos-session, but both csrfKey as well ass csrf-token

The account page only allows changing of the email, and I can't see a way to use it to manipulate the cookie. So for the first time it is actually due to check the public blog page.

I see two places to input data, the search feature and the leave a comment functionality.
The comment feature does not show anything interesting, but when searching something the response looks interesting:
