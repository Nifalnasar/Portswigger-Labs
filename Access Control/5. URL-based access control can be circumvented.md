## Solution:

We can see the Admin panel link present.

Try to load /admin and observe that we get blocked. Notice that the response is very plain, suggesting it may originate from a front-end system.

Send the request to Burp Repeater. Change the URL in the request line to / and add the HTTP header X-Original-URL: /invalid. Observe that the application returns a "not found" response. This indicates that the back-end system is processing the URL from the X-Original-URL header.

Some application frameworks support various non-standard HTTP headers that can be used to override the URL in the original request, such as X-Original-URL and X-Rewrite-URL. If a web site uses rigorous front-end controls to restrict access based on URL, but the application allows the URL to be overridden via a request header, then it might be possible to bypass the access controls using a request like the following.

so to acces the admin panel we need to give the payload ```X-Original-Url: /admin```

To delete carlos we need to give the payload ```X-Original-Url: /admin/delete``` and add ```?username=carlos``` to the real query string

And send this request to orginal.And carlos got deleted we can verfy it by sending admin request again and search carlos in that.
